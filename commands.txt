We'll need:

A command to start the counter
 - Clear /tmp/stopwatch if it exists
 - start a counter with the provided timeframe
 - save it to /tmp/stopwatch
 - save the PID
rm -f /tmp/stopwatch >/dev/null  ; sh -c 'echo $$ > /tmp/stopwatch_pid; exec termdown {tmux_input} -o /tmp/stopwatch > /dev/null '


A command to pause the counter
 - kill the process with the previously acquired PID
 - Show time in /tmp/stopwatch?

 A command to restart the counter
 - Clear /tmp/stopwatch (must save the time)  "$(< /tmp/stopwatch | head -n 1)" 
 - start a counter with the porvided time, saving to /tmp/stopwatch
 - will have a new PID
